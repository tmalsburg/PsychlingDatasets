A directory of publicly available data sets from psycholinguistic studies.  At this time fairly empty.

**Who can contribute:**  Anyone can contribute their own data sets or add information about other people’s data sets if there is a link, the data was published with the author’s consent, and there is a publication that describes the data.

**How to contribute:** [Click here to edit](https://github.com/tmalsburg/PsychlingDatasets/edit/master/README.md) this page.  Editing requires that you have a Github account.  [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is used for formatting.  Before submitting your contribution, write a one-sentence summary of what you changed.

**Structure of this document:** We’ll start with a simple list of data sets and will evolve this into something more organized as the list grows.  However, for each entry please provide at least the following information:

1. Reference for the paper in which the data was first described ideally with link
1. Type of data (e.g., self-paced reading, grammaticality judgments, language, …)
1. URL of the data set

Entries are separated by a horzontal rule (`---`).
